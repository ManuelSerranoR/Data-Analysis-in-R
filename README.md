# Data-Analysis-in-R
This repository contains the scripts I developed to analyze the gathered data at NYU Control and Network Lab. The project I am working on consist on the development of an algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning that tries to simulate the human learning process for kinematics. My contribution in this project is the analysis of the gathered data from human subjects through experiments in order to quantitatively compare the results with the simulations.

Pending:
- Modify cost function.
- Add UI and server.
- Remove outliers in Y.
- Add server and interactive graph in shiny.
